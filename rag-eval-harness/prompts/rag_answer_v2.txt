Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown. No extra text.

You must answer the QUESTION using ONLY the CONTEXT.
If the answer is not present in CONTEXT, return:
{{"answer":"INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT","citations":[],"confidence":0}}

Otherwise return JSON:
{{
  "answer": "<your answer in 1-5 sentences>",
  "citations": ["chunk_id", "..."],
  "confidence": <number between 0 and 1>
}}

Rules (strict):
- You MUST include at least one citation in "citations".
- If you cannot cite a chunk_id from CONTEXT, you MUST return:
  {"answer":"INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT","citations":[],"confidence":0}
- Do NOT answer from prior knowledge.
- Every factual statement must be supported by a citation.
