It utilizes the HNSW algorithm (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs) for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, which is optimized for high-dimensional data and can efficiently handle millions of vectors with high queries-per-second throughput [source1__0004].\n\nQdrant stores vectors along with associated JSON payloads (metadata), allowing for filtering of search results based on these fields without significant performance degradation. This feature, known as \"filterable HNSW,\" enhances the database's capability to manage and retrieve data effectively [source1__0004].", "retrieved_chunk_ids": ["source1__0004", "source1__0080", "source1__0048", "source1__0007", "source1__0058"], "latency_ms": 7455.4, "format_valid": true, "citation_count": 2, "citation_coverage": true, "context_hit": false, "retrieved_text_preview": ["Why Qdrant?\nThere are many vector databases out there – so why choose Qdrant?
